## Other Formats

I have created templates for MediaWiki that do basically the same thing as the other charts available on this site. You can find the templates as well as instructions on how to use them at [StrategyWiki](http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Template:Kbdchart) and [Fandom](http://templates.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Kbdchart). By selecting the "MediaWiki" format type, you can generate the code you will need to fill the template with data and display a keyboard diagram on a MediaWiki wiki. On the destination wiki page, you may also want to wrap the chart in a scrollable DIV element, since the chart is wider than a typical browser window.

I have also created SVG versions of the charts, which you can also select in the "Format" menu on the main page. I have not migrated over to using SVG for everything yet, because it is less compatible with older browsers, and I have not decided how I want to implement the mouse and joystick controls listings. (Also, I have not yet figured out how to create containers that expand, wrap and scale automatically as the amount of text inside them increases.)

PDF versions of the charts will hopefully be added at some point in the future.
