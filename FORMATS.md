## Other Formats

I have created templates for MediaWiki wikis that do basically the same thing 
as the charts available on this site. You can find templates as well as 
instructions on how to use them at 
[StrategyWiki](http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Template:Kbdchart) and 
[Fandom](http://templates.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Kbdchart). By selecting the 
&quot;MediaWiki&quot; format type on the front page, you can generate the code 
you will need in order to populate the template with data. Note that on the 
destination wiki page, you may also want to wrap the charts in scrollable DIV 
elements, since the charts are wider than a typical browser window.

I have also created SVG versions of the charts that you can select in the 
&quot;Format&quot; menu on the front page. I have not migrated over to using 
SVG for everything yet since it is less compatible with older browsers. 
Further, I have not yet decided how I want to implement the mouse and joystick 
controls charts, and this will affect my future choices. (In particular, I have 
not yet figured out how to create text containers in SVG that expand, wrap and 
scale automatically as the number of characters inside them increases.)

PDF versions of the charts will hopefully be implemented at some point in the 
future. Right now the PDF option is still disabled in the menu. That being 
said, there are virtual printer drivers such as &quot;Microsoft Print to 
PDF&quot; or &quot;Adobe Print to PDF&quot; that will allow you to print any 
document to PDF, even from your Web browser.
