I am no longer able to create new stored procedures or edit old ones due to a 
change in my web host's security policies. For some reason I am also unable to 
export them.

The file "isometr1_keyboard_missing_routines.sql" contains some of these stored 
procedures, from back when I was still able to export them. It does not include 
all of the stored procedures, however. Some are missing.

At some point in time I will either need to change web hosts, or convert the 
stored procedures to PHP code.
