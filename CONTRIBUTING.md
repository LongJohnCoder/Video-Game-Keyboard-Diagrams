contains the project's update history and credits, as well as links to further 
reading. The [&quot;to do&quot; list](TODOLIST.md) outlines some of the tasks I've 
planned for the future.

To submit a new set of bindings, you can fill out [this spreadsheet](https://github.com/mjhorvath/Video-Game-Keyboard-Diagrams/blob/master/helper_tools/vgkd_bindings_template.xlsx) 
and [email me](http://isometricland.net/email.php) the contents by copying and 
pasting. Note that any content you submit falls under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license, 
as per the project as a whole. Your name will then appear at the bottom of each 
chart you contributed to.

I have also developed a form-based submission page. You can use it by selecting 
the &quot;Editor&quot; option in Step 4, above. To update a game's binding 
simply select it from the &quot;Games&quot; menu above. To start a brand new 
submission, select the &quot;Blank Starter&quot; item in the 
&quot;Reference&quot; category of the &quot;Games&quot; menu. There are 
&quot;Blank Starters&quot; for every keyboard. All that being said, I 
personally still prefer using the spreadsheet for new submissions.
