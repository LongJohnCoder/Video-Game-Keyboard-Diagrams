Video Game Keyboard Diagrams

A set of PHP forms and MySQL databases that generate keyboard control diagrams in a new window. You can select from among hotkeys and bindings for various video games and other software. If you do not have a JavaScript-enabled browser, then you may refer to the master list table instead, as it should be viewable in a JavaScript-less browser.
