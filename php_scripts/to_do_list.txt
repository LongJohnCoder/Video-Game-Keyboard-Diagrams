TO DO LIST

- In the submission form, selecting a colored OPTION element should maybe 
  change the color of the corresponding parent SELECT element as well.
- An warning should be thrown ONUNLOAD if someone attempts to leave the 
  submission form and there is any unsaved or unsubmitted data.
- Make sure all buttons in the submission form have their TITLE attributes set.
- The Creative Commons icons need to have their ALT attributes set.
- The CAPTCHA dialog should check for a correct security code *before* sending 
  the user on to the next page. At the very least, it should warn the user that 
  he or she will not be able to return to the form page after making a 
  submission.
- I would like to maybe store the SVG patterns, filters and gradients in 
  separate files, rather than cluttering up the main SVG file. Since there are 
  only a dozen or so styles, however, it's not currently a big deal.
- Continue developing the "Spreadsheet View", and permit users to set or update 
  the keyboard data from there.
- Convert email TABLE to DIVs.
