TO DO LIST

+ In the submission form, selecting a colored OPTION element should change the 
  color of the corresponding parent SELECT element as well.
+ An warning should be thrown ONBEFOREUNLOAD if someone attempts to leave the 
  submission form and there is any unsaved or unsubmitted data.
+ Make sure all buttons in the submission form have their TITLE attributes set.
+ The Creative Commons and GNU icons need to have their ALT attributes set.
+ The CAPTCHA dialog should check for a correct security code *before* sending 
  the user on to the next page. At the very least, it should warn the user that 
  he or she will not be able to return to the form page after making a 
  submission.
- Should maybe store the SVG patterns, filters and gradients in separate files, 
  rather than cluttering up the main SVG file. Since there are only a dozen or 
  so styles, however, it's not currently a big deal.
- Continue developing the "Spreadsheet View", and permit users to alter and 
  update the keyboard data from there.
+ Convert email input TABLEs to DIVs.
- Sub-pages maybe don't need to repeat the parent project's title since it 
  already appears in the site's horizontal breadcrumbs. Not sure.
+ Need a loading icon since it takes a while for all the AJAX stuff (e.g. 
  reCAPTCHA) to download completely.
- I should change all the various alerts boxes to something prettier.
- The "required" attribute of the email INPUT elements should cause the 
  submission form to not post if those INPUTs are not filled properly. This 
  includes the email address field, which requires special syntax.
