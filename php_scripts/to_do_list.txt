SUBMISSION FORM TO DO LIST

* Selecting a colored OPTION element should change the color of the 
  corresponding SELECT element as well.
* An ONUNLOAD warning should be thrown if someone attempts to leave the page 
  and there is any unsaved data.
* Make sure all buttons have a TITLE attribute set.
* The Creative Commons icons need to have ALT attributes configured.
* The CAPTCHA dialog should check for a correct security code *before* sending 
  the user on to the next page. At the very least, it should warn users that 
  they will not be able to return to the submission page later.
