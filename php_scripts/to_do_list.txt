TO DO LIST

Completed tasks are marked with a plus '+'.
Partially completed or problematic tasks are marked with a tilde '~'.
Canceled, broken or non-implementable tasks are marked with an 'x'.
Incomplete tasks are marked with a minus '-'.

+ In the submission form, selecting a colored OPTION element should change the 
  color of the corresponding parent SELECT element as well.
+ An warning should be thrown ONBEFOREUNLOAD if someone attempts to leave the 
  submission form and there is any unsaved or unsubmitted data.
+ Make sure all buttons in the submission form have their TITLE attributes set.
+ The Creative Commons and GNU icons need to have their ALT attributes set.
+ The CAPTCHA dialog should check for a correct security code *before* sending 
  the user on to the next page. At the very least, it should warn the user that 
  he or she will not be able to return to the form page after clicking the 
  submit button.
- Should maybe store the SVG patterns, filters and gradients in separate files, 
  rather than cluttering up the main SVG file. But since there are only a dozen 
  or so styles at this time, it may not currently be a big deal.
- Continue developing the "Spreadsheet View" of the submission form, and permit 
  users to alter or update the keyboard data using it if they want to.
+ Convert input TABLEs to DIVs.
- Sub-pages should maybe not repeat the parent project's title since the title 
  already appears in the site's horizontal breadcrumbs. Not sure.
+ Need a loading icon since it takes a while for all the AJAX stuff (e.g. 
  reCAPTCHA) to download completely.
- I should change all the various alerts boxes to something prettier.
+ The "required" attribute of the email INPUT elements should cause the 
  submission form to not post if those INPUTs are not filled properly. This 
  includes the email address field, which requires special syntax.
- The key caption legend should also be configurable.
x Finish implementing the "languages" table.
+ The footer is the same for many of the views. It could be placed in a 
  separate file and simply included.
- Add timestamp columns to the various SQL tables to record the dates and times 
  when rows were added or last modified.
- I would also like to create charts/diagrams for gamepads, mice and joysticks, 
  but the sheer number of different devices will make this task very difficult.
+ It may be better to reverse the order of the selection dialogs on the front 
  page. E.g. select the Keyboard first, then the Style, and then the Game. 
  Otherwise, finding bindings for the German or French keyboards will be like 
  searching for a needle in a haystack.
- Not sure whether the sitemap should list each game once for every platform or 
  layout. Does it confuse the search engines to have multiples of each game?
+ Game genres should be listed alphabetically instead of by the 
  "genre_displayorder" column (which happens to be alphabetical, too, and is 
  thus redundant).
- Should the accordion menus be sorted alphabetically, or should I add a 
  "displayorder" column to the SQL tables?
- Should mouse, joystick, etc. commands be lined up neatly with left and right 
  parts separated by an equal '=' sign, for instance using a table? Or should I 
  instead use a definition list?
- Instead of one genre per game, I could create a tag cloud so that a game can  
  be placed into multiple genres. What type of GUI do I need to facilitate this 
  and allow  visitors to select more than one genre?
- How granular should I get WRT video game genres? Should I list sub- and sub-
  sub-genres? How many? Which ones?
- Rename "Win" key to "Super" or "Meta"?
~ Remake the loading icon in animated WebP format. Does this graphics format 
  work properly in other browsers besides Google Chrome?
- Find out if the Git Powershell tool can accept multi-line change notes.
- I merged the HTML and SVG formats into one format. The diagrams are no longer 
  rendered using pure HTML code, and the SVG file is now once again embedded 
  within an HTML wrapper. (This is how the old "embed" format worked.) Not sure 
  what effect this will have on search engines, however.
