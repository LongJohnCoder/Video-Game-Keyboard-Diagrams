In order for VGKD to work properly, it requires these following things:

* "Simple JQuery Accordion menu" by Marco van Hylckama Vlieg
* CSS code from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_checkbox.asp
* jQuery 1.2.1 or higher
* Two icons provided by Creative Commons for CC BY-SA 3.0 and GPLv3.
  * https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CC-BY-SA_icon_white.svg
  * https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:License_icon-gpl-88x31-2.svg
* I have refrained from including several open source fonts that may be needed 
  by some of the themes.
* "CaptchaSecurityImages.php"
