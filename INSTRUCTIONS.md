## Instructions

This PHP form generates a keyboard control diagram in a new window. You can select from among hotkeys and bindings for various video games and other software. If you do not have a JavaScript-enabled browser, then you may refer to the [master list](http://isometricland.net/keyboard/keyboard-list.php) table instead, as it should be viewable in a JavaScript-less browser. If you are looking for Apple or non-English bindings, you may *also* have an easier time searching the master list, as there are so few of them.

1. Select a keyboard (key positions).
1. Select a theme (visual formatting).
1. Select a game (key bindings).
1. Select a format (output media type).
1. Toggle the numeric keypad on/off.
1. Click on the &quot;Create New Diagramhttp://templates.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Kbdchart button. A new window with your selected diagram will appear.
1. View or print the page in the new window.

Items marked with a star (&#10022;) are the &quot;default&quot; or most common options.

The vast majority of the bindings are for the *US 104 Key (ANSI)* keyboard at this time. If you would like to see more bindings for the other keyboards, you are welcome to contribute!
