## Printing Tips

1. When printing, the chart may not fit within a single letter- or legal-sized 
page, even when selecting 'Landscape' mode instead of &quot;Portrait&quot; mode 
in your printer dialog settings. Luckily, your browser or printer may have a 
&quot;shrink to fit&quot; feature that you can take advantage of to 
automatically adjust the size of the printed page output. Unfortunately, 
Google Chrome is missing a &quot;shrink to fit&quot; feature by default, so I 
recommend investigating one of the workarounds discussed on Super User, 
[here](https://superuser.com/questions/979741/how-can-i-make-chrome-shrink-to-fit-on-printing).
1. You may save a little more space by also hiding the numeric keypad. Be aware 
that many games have commands bound to these keys!
1. I recommend not enabling the printing of background colors and images in 
your printer settings, as this will consume a lot of ink. This setting is found 
in &quot;Page Setup&quot; (Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer) or within the 
print dialog itself (Google Chrome). The setting appears to not exist in 
Microsoft Edge.
1. If the colors or keyboard theme are not to your liking, select a different 
&quot;Theme&quot; from among the options at the top of this page, then try 
generating the chart again.
1. Printing at 96dpi (dots-per-inch) and 100% scaling should result in a 
printed page that closely approximates the size and dimensions of many real 
physical keyboards. Of course, not every keyboard is exactly the same, so YMMV.
1. On Windows, some Web browers (Google Chrome for instance) use your desktop 
DPI scaling settings to adjust the size of on-screen HTML elements, resulting 
in a document that can appear larger or smaller than normal. I don't know if 
this affects the printed page output, however.
1. Note, that the darker themes in general will use up a lot of ink.
